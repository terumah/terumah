# Terumah: Actualization Community
## Abstract
Blockchain technology grants us a toolset and a canvas to renovate our world. Much of the attention of late has focused on its category better capacity to move and raise capital. We propose a new experiment focused on community bootstrapping, communal self-defense and full communal actualization rather than capital raising.

Today we live in communities of happenstance and duress. This situation blocks the fulfillment of human potential. Working bottom up means returning to the axioms of what a community can be and writing anew. Can the life of a community be implemented in code? Working bottom-up with our new tools can we reimagine what a community can be and use this technology to subsume compromise and realize our ideals?

The thesis: just as through blockchain, an attack resistant system, the free flow of value cannot be stopped, through this new technology a free group of people committed to mutual actualization cannot be stopped.
